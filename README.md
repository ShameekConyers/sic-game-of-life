## Game

Currently theres' no interaction, you can just fire it up and see how the system
evolves over time. Every time you run it the system will have a different start
value. Based on Conway's "Game of Life" with a random number generator that
introduces chaos with cells either spontaneously dieing or becomeng alive

## Installation instructions

Since this was developed & compiled on my M1 Macbook only MacOS is supported
currently. To downloaf simply download the repo and click 'run.command'

## Source Code

Code used to build this is found in the root/src folder, <a href ="https://github.com/ShameekConyers/siclib/tree/main/src/sicdev/game-of-life">
more up to date source files can be found here </a>

## TODO

Right now there's no mouse interaction or restarting, thus those are next to be
implemented.
