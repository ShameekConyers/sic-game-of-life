## Game

Currently theres' no interaction, you can just fire it up and see how the system
evolves over time. Every time you run it the system will have a different start
value.

## Installation instructions

Since this was developed & compiled on my M1 Macbook only MacOS is supported
currently. To Download simply grab the file sic-gol.out and run it from the
command line.

## Source Code

Code used to build this is found in the root/src folder, [more up to date source
files can be found here]("https://github.com/ShameekConyers/siclib/tree/main/src/sicdev/game-of-life" "Title")

## TODO

Right now there's no mouse interaction or restarting, thus those are next ot be
implementing.
